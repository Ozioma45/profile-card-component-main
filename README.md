## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

 Getting the background to look similar to the design was really difficult that i had to use "position" css layout property to achieve it which i dont use often.
 with this, I guess i have to work with it in the position for beta understanding
